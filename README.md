# CV Pong

A one-week coding challenge to create a version of Pong controlled through hand-tracking.

## Setup

First, download this repository to your computer. Before running it, ensure you are running Python 3.10. If you are
unsure, you can [download python 3.10 for your system here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).
Once you have, install the necessary libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the `cv-pong`
directory. Finally, to run the code, `cd` into `cv_pong` and run `main.py` using your install of Python 3.10
